This is an autogenerated README for the <%= name %> project.

Things you can do:
  -- run the tests by running 'tbc'
  -- have an automatic test loop by running 'watchr watchr.rb'
  -- install locally with "cabal install"
  -- push to hackage with "FIXME"
  -- push to github with "git push"

Pushing to github should run the tests on the CI server too.
